## Usecase: Adult dataset

We want to demonstrate the main functionalities of AutoxgboostMC in a use-case using the *Adult Dataset*.
It is based on a 1994 Census database and aims to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year.
While we want to predict this binary classification problem as good as possible, we also want to prevent our model from discriminating against a person's sex.
To achieve this kind of fairness, we are also optimizing the well known F1 measure within each group.

First, we access the dataset from the *OpenML* database by the `OpenML` R-package.
It also allows to directly transform the dataset into a mlr-task object.

```{r}
library(OpenML)
adult = convertOMLDataSetToMlr(getOMLDataSet(1590))
```

The goal of our analysis is to equally optimize the mean miss-classification error as well as a fairness measure.
In this case, we define a fairness measure as our model's absolute difference in F1-Scores between two groups.
Hence, as a second step, we define our fair F1 measure by specifying the grouping variable `sex`.

```{r}
data = getTaskData(adult)
sex_fairf1 = setMeasurePars(fairf1, grouping = data$sex)
```

Now its time to create our AutoxgboostMC object.

```{r}
axgb = AutoxgboostMC$new(
  task = adult, # adult task
  measures = list(mmce, sex_fairf1) # measures to optimize
)
```

We can now start the training process with some initial iterations.

```{r}
set.seed(20190606)
axgb$fit(iterations = 20L, plot = FALSE)
```

After the fitting for the first time we can select a region of the Pareto front, we want to focus on
and continue the training with more iterations.

```{r}
p1 = axgb$plot_pareto_front_projections(wt_range = c(0.1, 0.9))

axgb$optimizer$set_possible_projections(c(0.1, 0.9))
axgb$fit(iterations = 50L, plot = FALSE)
p2 = axgb$plot_pareto_front_projections(wt_range = c(0.1, 0.9))
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
load(file = "vignettes/results.RData")
p1
p2
```


We can repeat this process until we are happy with the results.

```{r}
axgb$optimizer$set_possible_projections(c(0.1, 0.9))
axgb$fit(iterations = 50L, plot = FALSE)
p3 = axgb$plot_pareto_front_projections(wt_range = c(0.1, 0.9))
p3
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
p3
```

Then, we can nicely plot the results with patchwork.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
(p1  + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0.1, 0.3), ylim = c(0, 0.0015))) +
(p2  + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0.1, 0.3), ylim = c(0, 0.0015))) +
(p3  + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0.1, 0.3), ylim = c(0, 0.0015)))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
pareto_plots
```

Moreover, we can have a look at the parallel coordinates.

```{r}
axgb$plot_parallel_coordinates()
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
load("par_coord_plot.RData")
par_coord_plot
```

A big problem in human-in-the-loop approaches is often the reproducibility of obtained results.
In our case, if we set a seed before starting our analysis, and a user provides the code used
in order to intervene in the process, the process is thus fully reproducible.
