\arguments{
\item{grouping}{[`function`Â | `factor` | `character`]\cr
Either a function(df), a factor or a character column name that returns a factor.
If `function(df)`, df is the output of `getTaskData()`.
This factor is then used to split the data and compute differences between groups.
Grouping can be set via `setMeasurePars`.}
}
\description{
Fair algorithms usually are defined as having similar performances within
different dataset splits.
We implement the following measures:\cr
}
\details{
Independence `fairpr` \cr
Sufficiency `fairf1` | `fairfpr` | `varf1` \cr
Callibration `fairppv` \cr

The arguments can be set via `extra.args` for all measures.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{setMeasurePars(fairf1, grouping = function(df) {as.factor(df$age > 30)})}
